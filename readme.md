# Keycloak.X Quarkus - Helm Chart

A Helm chart for deploying the latest Quarkus based distrubtion of Keycloak (aka Keycloak.X or version 17+).  
The chart support for external database, ingress, clustering and secret creation and exposes many of the Keycloak configuration variables in a more friendly and discoverable way

## Quick Start

Keycloak.X has been designed to be run from a customized image where `kc.sh build` has been run to tailor the configuration [see the docs](https://www.keycloak.org/server/containers)

See the [build](./build/) folder for some example Dockerfiles.

However it is possible to deploy the vanilla un-customized Keycloak image:

```bash
helm install kc ./keycloak --set 'keycloak.args=["start"]'
```

The admin user password will be autogenerated and placed into a secret (see [Admin User](#admin-user) below), get the password with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret kc-keycloak-admin -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```

Using port-forward to connect to Keycloak and login with the admin account:

```bash
kubectl port-forward kc-keycloak-0 8080:8080
```

## Chart Configuration Values

[See the chart readme](./keycloak/README.md) for a full list of values that can be set. Many of these "wrap" Keycloak environmental variables

## Admin User

The values `keycloak.adminUser` and `keycloak.adminPasswordSecret` control the creation of the admin user account. If `adminPasswordSecret` is not set, the a secret will be automatically created and a random password generated. Otherwise you can use `keycloak.adminPasswordSecret.name` and `.key` to reference an existing secret you want to use.

## Ingress

It's generally expected that a Kubernetes ingress is put in front of Keycloak rather than exposing Keycloak directly, which is why the default proxy mode for the chart is `edge` this disables HTTPS and TLS on Keycloak, so that TLS can be terminated by the ingress.

[See the Keycloak docs](https://www.keycloak.org/server/reverseproxy) and the chart value `keycloak.proxyMode` setting.

The simplest configuration possible would be:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: keycloak.example.net
```

Should you wish to enable TLS, specify the `secretName` holding the cert (issuing of certs & TLS secrets is deemed outside the scope of this chart), e.g.

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: keycloak.example.net
  tls:
    enabled: true
    secretName: benco-io-cert
```

## Database Configuration

If the Keycloak image has been [configured/built with database support](https://www.keycloak.org/server/db), the runtime options for the database can be passed by the values under `keycloak.database`, e.g. `keycloak.database.host` etc

The value `keycloak.database.passwordSecret` is expected to stored as a key in a secret, the creation and management of this secret is outside the scope of this chart.

**ðŸ“ƒ NOTE** If the image has been built with database support, and database configuration is not provided, then Keycloak defaults to certain internal parameters e.g. localhost for the database, naturally this will fail.

NOTE Only MS-SQL Server has been tested at this current time

## Clustering

If the Keycloak image has been [configured/built with distributed caching in order to run in a cluster](https://www.keycloak.org/server/caching), then the deployment to Kubernetes can run across multiple pods.

To enable clustering and multiple pods:

- Set the `replicaCount` to a value greater than 1
- Set `keycloak.clustered` to _true_

When `keycloak.clustered` is set to _true_ twothings are done by the chart:

- A additional headless service is created in front of the pods, allowing for DNS discovery.
- Extra parameter is passed to the Keycloak startup script, which is `-Djgroups.dns.query`. This is set to point at the name of the headless service.

**ðŸ“ƒ NOTE 1** If clustering (i.e. a cache stack provider) has been enabled in the Keycloak image, then `keycloak.clustered` **must be set to true**, even if the replicaCount is 1. Keycloak will fall over if `dns.query` is not set

**ðŸ“ƒ NOTE 2** Only the Kubernetes cache stack provider has been tested, e.g. `KC_CACHE_STACK=kubernetes` when running `kc.sh build`

## URL Path

Should you wish to serve Keycloak from a different URL path, this can only be done when building the Keycloak image, e.g. `KC_HTTP_RELATIVE_PATH=/foo` when running `kc.sh build`

If this has been done, then `keycloak.healthCheckPath` will need to be adjusted, e.g. `/foo/realms/master`
